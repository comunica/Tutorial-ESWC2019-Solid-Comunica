## Material
{:#material}

The tutorial will be guided by slides,
which will be shared online after the session.
For the hands-on coding sessions, we will provide
a git repository with separate branches for all sequentially completed tasks.
This will allow participants that are unable to complete a certain task,
to still begin with the next task by checking out a different branch.

The slides and git repository will be made available one month before the tutorial.
All material will be made open for everyone under the CC BY 4.0 license.

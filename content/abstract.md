## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Solid is a decentralized application and storage ecosystem, 
built on the Linked Data principles.
It enables true data ownership,
where anyone can store data in a place of their choice,
regardless of the applications they use.
In order to build decentralized applications over Solid data pods,
specialized querying techniques are required.
Comunica is a flexible meta query engine
that offers such querying capabilities.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to enable developers and researchers
to start building such decentralized applications,
<!-- Task         -->
we offer a tutorial on Solid and Comunica,
<!-- Object       -->
This tutorial consists of an overview of Solid,
and on how Comunica can be used to query Solid data pods.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
As a result, participants from different backgrounds
will have experience with hosting data through their own personal Solid data pod.
Furthermore, they will be able to query over Solid data pods,
using different querying techniques with Comunica.
Ultimately, this will enable the development and research of
decentralized applications with the Solid platform.

## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Solid is a decentralized storage platform,
built on Linked Data principles.
It enables _true data ownership_,
where anyone can store data in one or more Solid _data pods_.
In order to build _decentralized_ applications over Solid data pods,
specialized querying techniques are required.
Comunica is a flexible _meta query engine_
that offers such querying capabilities.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to enable developers and researchers
to start building such decentralized applications,
<!-- Task         -->
we offer a tutorial on Solid and Comunica,
<!-- Object       -->
This tutorial consists of an overview of Solid,
and on how Comunica can be used to query Solid data pods.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
As a result, participants from different backgrounds
will have experience with hosting data through their own personal Solid data pod.
Furthermore, they will be able to query over Solid data pods,
using different querying techniques with Comunica.
Ultimately, this will enable the development and research of
decentralized applications with the Solid platform.

In the past, there were tutorials on Solid at the
[Decentralized Web Summit 2018](https://decentralizedwebsummit2018.sched.com/event/Fg5q/workshop-building-solid-apps-a-hands-on-tutorial){:.mandatory},
and at the [DeSemWeb workshop at ISWC 2018](http://iswc2018.desemweb.org/program/){:.mandatory}.
The Decentralized Web Summit tutorial ([https://solid.github.io/dweb-summit-2018/](https://solid.github.io/dweb-summit-2018/)) had 50 participants,
while the DeSemWeb workshop ([https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Solid-DeSemWeb-2018/](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Solid-DeSemWeb-2018/))
had more than 60 participants.

There was one previous tutorial where Comunica was used
as a tool to demonstrate various querying capabilities in a tutorial
on [_Knowledge Representation as Linked Data_](cite:cites cikm)
([http://rml.io/cikm2018tutorial/](http://rml.io/cikm2018tutorial/)) at the CIKM conference 2018.
Furthermore, we will present a tutorial on Comunica at [ESWC 2019](https://comunica.github.io/Tutorial-ESWC2019-Comunica/){:.mandatory}.

This tutorial is relevant because
it is the first tutorial that combines Solid and Comunica.
As such, it offers participants hands-on experience on
building decentralized Linked Data applications.

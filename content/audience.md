## Audience
{:#audience}

This tutorial focuses on Web developers and researchers
that are want to use, develop, or research decentralized Web applications.
We assume elementary knowledge on Web technologies such as HTML and JavaScript.
Knowledge about RDF and SPARQL is beneficial, but not required.
We expect participants to bring a laptop that has a recent Web browser,
[git](https://git-scm.com/){:.mandatory}, and an editor or IDE with JavaScript support.
The end-goal is to provide participants with sufficient knowledge and experience
to build applications over Solid data pods using the Comunica query engine.
In order to attract participants,
we will announce it over the relevant decentralization and querying mailing lists,
via Twitter, and directly via Gitter chat channels focused on Linked Data development.
Given the high participation rate of the related Solid hands-on session at the DeSemWeb workshop at ISWC 2018,
we expect around 20 to 30 participants for this tutorial.
